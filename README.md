# Trend Micro Deep Security Migrator

Moves settings to the cloud.... at some point

Please do some code review if you want :)

## To Set Up MVP

1. Install deep security sdk

## Contributing

1. Run ./dev-setup.sh, which will download nix and nix flakes
2. run `nix develop` which will download and build dependencies, and drop you in a shell

(only tested on Arch and Ubuntu atm, so your mileage may vary)
